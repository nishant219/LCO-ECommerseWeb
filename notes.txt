(methods/functionalities in controller)->
(define route in routers and import methods here from controller)
(import those routes in app.js)


--->

create schema
write functionality in controller
create route in routes while importing controller
import that route in app.js

--->

what happens when someone hit route in routes-->
those methods we bring from respective controller


===>
app.use('/api/v1', home)
when you go to /api/v1 then home will take care of that route


==>
first work on user schema


===> 
cookies still there until expirary time so we have to delete them manually
#logout 
its frontend developers responsibility to delete those cookies from local state


--->
when someone visit /forgotPassword he will pass email in json 
then we will send email on that mail id
